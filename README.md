# Getting Started with Portfolio app

Hello Friends!

I am **Sagar Raut** from **India**.

I have created this portfolio project using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

GO ahead and download the project and then follow below commands into you terminal
###  `npm install`
###  ` npm start`
and it will start a local server at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

Please feel free to email me if you need any help!
